# Tic-Tac-Toe

Web version of game "Tic Tac Toe". This game can be played in the mode "player vs. player", when two users sit in front of the same monitor. One, who fills row, column or diagonal, wins the game. Game can be restarted at any time. Player one can only place character _X_, player two can place character _O_.

For implementation of this game next tools were used:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- Javascript.

In this project I applied OOP patterns **_Factory_** (players) and **_Module_** (gaming board for program and UI) for full implementation of game.

The Icon of game was taken from this [site](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/281462/tic-tac-toe).
